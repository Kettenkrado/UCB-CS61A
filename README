Hello, this is Lynn.
This is all the resources that I can find about CS61A Spring 2024.
Including the solutions which will no longer be available after this semester is closed.
current website: https://cs61a.org/

started on 23th, March, and finished on 27th, April.
Things to be done: hw09-11, lab12, disc12's solutions are not available yet. I'll get these things done before this semester is closed and sols are locked...before 7th, May, the final exam day maybe.
